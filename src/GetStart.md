  - What happened ?

    > *They will screw your code into a mess,  only the machine can understand, so always keep your eye on it, and make sure your code runs well. Otherwise, that machine gonna throw **a huge ugly red error block**, and it's gross!*
  
  - Who is the Evil Machine ?
    > *Called [JDK](https://jdk.java.net/ "JDK"). Once you install it and config the `JAVA_HOME` and `path`, and they want more, be careful with it.*

  - How to run a java file? With JDK already set up, compile your java code and run it.
    > *`javac`: means Java Control, and this thing screws your code, while they say it's a compiler command. Terrible.*

    > *`java`: Boom! Yes, this command is not for us, the Machine will run your code with it.*

  - Arm Yourself: 
    > *Never fly solo. Pick up an **IDE** along with you.*

    > [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)? [IDEA](https://netbeans.apache.org/)? [NetBeans](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)?

    > *My true love is ***[Virtual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)****
